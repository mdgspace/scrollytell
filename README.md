## Terminology and Explanation

#### Panel
Panel is a widget. The list of panels form a scrolling sequence. In simple words, each panel is widget that remains in foreground while scrolling.

#### OverlayWidget
The overlay widget is what you want to be dynamically changed as you scroll.
For example: In a simple story telling app, the panel will consist of a text portion of the story, while the OverlayWidget shows a corresponding graphic.

#### guideline
Guideline is an _imaginary_ reference line. When the panel's top coincide with the guideline we say panel has been 'started' or the panel is 'active' and `panelStartCallback` is called. Similarily when panel's bottom touch guideline we say panel is ended and`panelEndCallback` is called.
You can choose the guidelinePosition to be either at ScrollyWidget's top, center, bottom.

#### activePanelIndex
An integer value corresponding to the panel that is "active"(coincides with the guideline).

#### progress (0,1)
A double value that depicts how much the panel has been scrolled past the guideline.
For example: When the center of panel reaches guideline progress is half.


## üéÆ How To Use

#### Declare a List of Widgets
```dart
List<Widget> panelList = [Text('Hello Scrollytell'), Text('Hello Flutter')];
```
#### Declare an Overlay Widget
```dart
Widget overlayWidget;
```
#### Declare a ScrollyWidget
```dart
Widget _scrollyWidget = ScrollyWidget(
		   showDebugConsole: true,
  	           guidelinePosition: GuidelinePosition.center,
                   panels: panelList,
                   panelStartCallback: (activePanelNumber, func){},
                   panelEndCallback: (endingPanelNumber, func){},
                   panelProgressCallback: (activePanelNumber, progress, func){
    
                // set properties of overlay widget using activePanelNumber and progress
        
                       double rad = (progress <= 0.5) ? progress * 200 : 200 - progress * 200;
                       overlayWidget = Center(
                           child: Container(
                               width: 200,
                               height: 200,
                               decoration: BoxDecoration(
                                   borderRadius: BorderRadius.all(
                                       Radius.circular(rad),
                                   ),
                               color: Colors.red,
                               ),
                           ),
                       );
        
                // then pass it into the function
        
                       func(overlayWidget)
                   },
               )
```

#### Now Wrap it in either Expanded, Flexible or Container
> Option 1 : Wrap in Expanded for covering the remaining screen.
```dart
Expanded(child: _scrollyWidget)
```
> Option 2 : Wrap in Flexible
```dart
Flexible(child: _scrollyWidget)
```
> Option 3 : Wrap in container to give it desired size.
```dart
Container(height: 500, width: 300, child: _scrollyWidget)
```
#### OR Use it directly as body of Scaffold.
```dart
Scaffold(body: _scrollyWidget)
```

For more info, refer to the `basic_usage` app in the example.

## Some usage tips for beginners

#### Setting the overlay widget.
* The overlayWidget will continue to be the one which was last set in the callback(s) unless you explicitly change it.
* When you do not want to display anything at overlayWidget set it to be `Container()`

#### adding a "fake panel"
* Sometimes you may want to include want to include containers at start (maybe a heading) and want it
to scroll with your actual panels. The best option is to add it as a panel in the `panelList` and not
manipulate the overlayWidget when activePanelIndex is 1.
* A similar approach can be applied when you want include containers (like large empty spaces) in between
you actual panels (like, text portions of story). Just include the container at the appropriate position in the panelList
and not manipulate the overlayWidget when activePanelIndex is corresponding index.
