A collection of loading indicators animated with flutter. Heavily inspired by [@google](https://github.com/google)'s [Scrollytell](https://github.com/google/scrollytell).

## 🎖 Installing

dependencies:
  
```

### ⚡️ Import

```dart
import 'package:scrollytell/scrollytell.dart';
```

## 🎮 How To Use
#### Declare a List of Widgets
```dart
List<Widget> panelList = [Text('Hello Scrollytell'), Text('Hello Flutter')];
```
#### Declare an Overlay Widget
```dart
Widget overlayWidget;
```
#### Use ScrollyWidget as child or root
```dart
ScrollyWidget(
    height:500,
    width: 300,
    panels: panelList,
    panelStartCallback: (activePanelNumber, func){},
    panelEndCallback: (endingPanelNumber, func){},
    panelProgressCallback: (activePanelNumber, progress, func){
    
        // set properties of overlay widget using activePanelNumber and progress
        
        double rad = (progress <= 0.5) ? progress * 200 : 200 - progress * 200;
        overlayWidget = Center(
            child: Container(
                width: 200,
                height: 200,
                decoration: BoxDecoration(
                    borderRadius: BorderRadius.all(
                        Radius.circular(rad),
                    ),
                color: Colors.red,
                ),
            ),
        );
        
        // then pass it into the function
        
        func(overlayWidget)
    },
)
```
